# Python
What I am able to accomplish in Python

As a student, I have exhibited my skills and experience through assignments, papers, exams, labs, and more.
However, all of those assignments and workings are specifically related to my aforemention school.

This repository will have multiple things I have created in Python from varying difficulties.
One file may be a simple greeting, gathering user info, and outputting user info with concatenation.
On the other hand, other files may be more complicated with shapes, Python Turtles, networking, etc.

My hope is that I can send this repository across applications and on my resume and be able to have something to show
and my abilities. Thank you!
